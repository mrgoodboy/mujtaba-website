		<p>My name is Mujtaba Wani. </p>
		<p>I’m a sophomore at Yale University, and I’m majoring in Political Science and Humanities. Government, Religion, Ethics, and Economics are some of the subjects that interest me. My hobbies include reading, travelling, exercising, and dressing well. </p>
		<p>I was born in Kashmir. Because of political circumstances, my family immigrated to the United States when I was an infant of ten months. We have lived in Virginia since I was preschool. As a high school student in Virginia, I competed in Model United Nations and Speech and Debate. In my junior year of high school I served as a United States Senate Page in Washington, D.C.  </p>
		<p>Currently I am trying to figure out where I want to take my life. A lot of growing and experimenting is coming soon. The world has a lot of ice creams I have yet to enjoy.</p>
